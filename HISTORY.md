# Pandory v1.0.2 - 05-Mar-2020
1. LOADTIME settings altered for compatibility.
2. MAME SAVE STATE setting has been enabled to allow fixes for some titles.
3. PS1 / .PBP files now work.  The filename in CAPS won't run successfully, so Pandory now automatically changes filename from uppercase to lowercase.
