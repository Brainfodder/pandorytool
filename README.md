# Pandory "Backup-onna-stick"

Add these files to your USB stick. Make sure it is formatted in EXFAT (32K) 
and does not contain any other folders.

This update will backup your machine system/data-partitions to your USB stick.


## Notes

Insert this USB while booted. If the update gets stuck on a black screen with chinese text, 
reboot the machine and try again.

To back up the Key7, please use either a 32gb or 64gb stick! Your backup could be around 32gb on some variants!
