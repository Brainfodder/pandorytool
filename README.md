# PandoryJailbreak

WARNING: Before you begin, make sure you have backed up your machine and SD card!

Add these files to your USB stick. Make sure it is formatted in EXFAT (32K) 
and does not contain any other folders.

This will patch your system to run `pandory.sh` off the usb stick when inserted.

`pandory.sh` is a bash-shellscript. By default it starts the android launcher, but can
be configured to do anything you like.


## Notes

If the jailbreak gets stuck on a black screen with chinese text, reboot the machine
and try again.
